Cfx/FiveM Mod : AI Bus Transportation.   
This mod makes buses spawn, carry your player to the specified location dump the, then delete themselves.   
nothing flashy atm cos i havent played with ai yet or timings etc. next version will be much smoother and prettier but for now, here's something at least.   

### Dependancies  
1. [PolyZone](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone) - https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone   
^^^^ Mad props.... this script is awesome...   

### Usage  
1. install and run. no setup needed!   
2. add new stops to the server config! => handy command included (/getInfoForWaypoint)   

### Things planned to fix.   
1. The god awful AI. it's not TERRIBLE. but it's not great either.   
2. the bus stops. departures arent bad, but the stops are janky.   
3. the way locations are handled. i'd LIKE to tie them to actual bus stops. but again... Dat AI y'all.   

### Thanks to:
